/** Provides classes, objects and traits that specify the lanag.core architecture of the simulation framework.

  *
  * Most of the classes, objects and traits in this packages cannot be used on their own. Instead, they specify
  * what minimally should be implemented in any Lanag agent-based simulation.
  *
  * @see For an example implementation, see the source code of [[lanag.projects.ambiguityhelps]].
