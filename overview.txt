==Running simulation with spark-submit==

<code>spark-submit --class lanag.projects.ambiguityhelps.experiments.RSA1ShotConsistent --master local[4] Lanag2-assembly-0.2.jar</code>

==Running simulation from Intellij==
Intellij will ignore <code>% Provided</code> library dependencies by default. However, this means it cannot find the
Spark libraries, since these have to be tagged as such, because these are assumed to be supplied by the Spark
server. To run a simulation from within Intellij, you must edit the run configuration and under "Configuration"
check the option "Include dependencies with Provided scope".
